Project Overview

This project aims to develop AI and Machine Learning-based models to predict the prices of essential agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses (gram, tur, urad, moon, masur) and vegetables (onion, potato, tomato). The purpose is to help stabilize market volatility through better forecasting, enabling strategic market interventions like releasing buffer stocks.

The project utilizes statistical models such as ARIMA, as well as more advanced AI/ML techniques for forecasting prices. These models take into account factors like seasonality, historical price trends, emerging market trends, crop sowing, production estimates, and market intelligence.

Features

Data Sources: Price data is collected daily from 550 reporting centers across the country.
Commodities: The model focuses on pulses (gram, tur, urad, moon, masur) and vegetables (onion, potato, tomato).
Forecasting Models:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
AI/ML-based models (to be explored and developed)
Market Interventions: The model will assist in decisions like the release of buffer stocks to stabilize prices based on forecasted trends.
Methodology

Data Collection: Collect historical price data from government-monitored reporting centers.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for model training.
Model Development: Develop ARIMA-based and AI/ML models for price prediction.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
Forecasting: Predict future prices based on historical data and emerging trends.
Market Intervention: Use forecasted data to assist policymakers in making decisions related to buffer stock release.
